You're pretty close.  One of the most important features of a 'security camera&#34; is the ability to detect motion and record, especially when running on battery and limited storage space.  I tested the motion detect on this camera in a few different environments so far (i.e. low light, indoors, outdoors, etc..) and all I got was a SD card full of video triggers.  All the testing was done with the low motion sensitivity setting.  I can't even imagine what the high one would be.<br \\/>As others said, the low light operation is poor.  I did one of my tests outdoors as the sun was setting.  It was good until a point - then the camera started having seizures..it got fuzzy, went to black and white...back to color...then ultimately stabilized with lines across the screen.<br \\/>Another oddity I noticed was that the firmware reported in the windows config tool seemed later than the latest version posed on the Zetta site.  I'm not exactly sure why that is.<br \\/><br \\/>It gets two stars because there was one time, in a very light controlled indoor environment, where it didn't constantly trigger, so it MAY have some usefulness for your particular situation.  In adequate light, the video isn't too bad (you don't need HD for most security applications).<br \\/><br \\/>The are a variety of settings that are configurable, which is quite nice.  One setting that could, and should, be configurable is the amount of time it will record after the last trigger is detected.  The manual states that this is 5 minutes.  So, if someone enters the picture for 30 seconds then leaves, you conceivably would have 5 minutes of recording nothing afterwards.  This isn't power or memory efficient.<br \\/><br \\/>My original thought was to return this, but I want to crack it open and look at some of the internals.  I may decide to make my own.<br \\/><br \\/>I will continue to test and report any new developments.\",\"review_date\":\"2015-08-31\"}\n",

On the plus side it comes fully charged and ready to print<br \\/><br \\/>I went to load the paper into the printer, and there are warnings about not to bend the paper, leave it in the car, standard stuff.  Loading the printer was as easy as sliding the top off, and dropping the pack barcode down in the printer.  Getting the top back on required a few flips to find the right direction since it doesn't clearly line up which side the top slides back on from.<br \\/><br \\/>Note that the 2x3 print size is actually very small.  This should be obvious by the sizing, but make sure you understand what you are buying.  These aren't normal 3x5 photos even.<br \\/><br \\/>My first attempt to print was using a non rooted android one plus one running lollipop(oxygen OS).  I went to the app store and downloaded the Zink app.  For some reason the app caused my phone to work very hard and heat up, I haven't had issues with other apps doing this.  One thing I did notice while using the app was NFC options.  Which is neat you just put your phone on the printer and it loads up the app for you, very convenient and a nice touch.<br \\/><br \\/>While using the app it crashed several times on initial launch.  I tried to bluetooth pair the printer outside of the app and after a few attempts I was able to get it to pair.  However I was unable to print from the app with pairing the printer from the standard android bluetooth menu. I deleted the pairing and initiated the pair from within the app, this time it worked.<br \\/><br \\/>When I finally got the printer working it popped up telling me there was a critical firmware update for the printer.  I let it download and apply the update via bluetooth.  It took about 5 minutes to update, and the instructions said to wait for the printer to restart.  The printer never restarted and required a power on, but the update worked successfully.<br \\/><br \\/>I did find quite a few issues with the app.  The estimated percentage complete for sending to printer \\/ printing was wildly inaccurate.  I received several out of memory errors when trying to load larger pictures.<br \\/><br \\/>I also tried the same setup from an iPhone 6.  I downloaded the app, but was not given an option to pair bluetooth from within the app.  I did it from the system menu and it worked fine.  I didn't experience any crashes with smaller pictures.  The percentage completion bar was also more accurate.<br \\/><br \\/>Printing take approximately 40 seconds to send to printer, and another 35 seconds to print.  While the printer is printing, it is pretty quiet.  It does have a bit of a high pitch tone to it, which could get annoying to some people.  The first print takes a bit longer since it &#34;prints&#34; the barcode you use when loading the printer.<br \\/><br \\/>As for the quality of the prints, I used very high resolution DSLR pictures to try to pull the best photos possible from the little printer.  I noticed the colors are slightly muted, and the picture overall a bit darker.  Contrast was fairly low and there was a brownish tint to the photos, which almost looked like the standard instagram filter.  There was discoloring around the edges, and darker parts of photos were crushed into black. Some of the patterns such as on shirts, or with strands of hair remained, but gradual transitions looked muddy and unable to differentiate.<br \\/><br \\/>The resolution was OK for the size of the photo.  They look fine from 1-2ft away.  Some of the photos I printed I aimed to capitalize on the look of the prints, including a nearly black and white photo of a flower.  These turned out really well.  While printing photos straight from the iPhone \\/ One Plus One's camera resulted in even more muddying and lack of definition.<br \\/><br \\/>I was not able to smudge the images after printing, and the printer didn't seem to get too hot.  Based on battery life I would estimate around 10-15 prints max per charge.  There is an auto power off setting, but it seems the actual printing takes the majority of the battery.<br \\/><br \\/>The prints end up being very expensive with the proprietary paper you have to buy.  Instead of making money on ink\\/film\\/the device, they are clearly aiming to make the profit on the paper.  Also note that I was provided a sample of this product for my unbiased review.<br \\/><br \\/>----------------------------------------------<br \\/>Pros:<br \\/>* Cool concept<br \\/>* Makes stickers<br \\/>* Decent battery life<br \\/>* Fairly quick printing<br \\/><br \\/>Cons:<br \\/>* The quality of prints are low<br \\/>* Android app needs work<br \\/>* Very expensive per print<br \\/>* Very small print size.<br \\/><br \\/>In conclusion I would say this printer would be neat to print a quick sticker to put on something.  Or for younger kids to enjoy the printed results.  These are obviously not archival quality, or even enough quality to give to family members.  The expensive cost of prints may be a big limiting factor to the amount of use you will get out of this printer.d on battery life I would estimate around 10-15 prints max per charge.
